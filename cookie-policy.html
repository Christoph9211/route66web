            <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>What is this policy about?</strong><br>
            This document tells you about tracking technologies (“trackers”) that help this website achieve the purposes outlined in this document.</p>
            <p><strong>What are trackers?</strong><br>
            For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as "trackers" within this document – unless there is a reason to differentiate. For example, while cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based tracker. For this reason, within this document, the term cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of tracker.</p>
            <p>Some of the purposes for which trackers are used may also require your consent. Whenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.</p>
            <p>This website uses trackers managed directly by us (so-called “first-party” trackers) and trackers that enable services provided by a third-party (so-called “third-party” trackers). Unless otherwise specified within this document, third-party providers may access the trackers managed by them.</p>
            <p>The validity and expiration periods of cookies and other similar trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by us or the relevant provider. Some of them expire upon termination of your browsing session. In addition to what’s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below, you may find more precise and updated information regarding lifetime specification as well as any other relevant information — such as the presence of other trackers— in the linked privacy policies of the respective third-party providers or by contacting us.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Contact Information</h2>
            <p>Since the use of third-party trackers through this website cannot be fully controlled by us, any specific references to third-party trackers are to be considered indicative. In order to obtain complete information, you are kindly requested to consult the privacy policies of the respective third-party services listed in this document.</p>
            <p>Given the objective complexity surrounding tracking technologies, you are encouraged to contact us should you wish to receive any further information on the use of such technologies by this website.</p>

            <h2><strong>How to manage preferences and provide or withdraw consent</strong></h2>
            <p>There are various ways to manage tracker related preferences and to provide and withdraw consent, where relevant:</p>
            <p>You can manage preferences related to trackers from directly within your own device settings, for example, by preventing the use or storage of trackers.</p>
            <p>Additionally, whenever the use of trackers is based on consent, you can provide or withdraw such consent by setting your preferences within the cookie notice or by updating such preferences accordingly via the relevant consent-preferences privacy widget, if available.</p>
            <p>It is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to delete previously stored trackers, including those used to remember your initial consent preferences.</p>
            <p>Other trackers in the browser’s local memory may be cleared by deleting the browsing history.</p>
            <p>With regard to any third-party trackers, you can manage your preferences via the related opt-out link (where provided), by using the means indicated in the third party's privacy policy, or by contacting the third party.</p>
            <h3><strong>Locating tracker settings</strong></h3>
