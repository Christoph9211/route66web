              <h3>About this section</h3>
              <p>This section supplements the rest of our Privacy Policy. It is provided by the business operating this website and, where applicable, its parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates (collectively, “we,” “us,” or “our”).</p>
            
              <h4>Applicability</h4>
              <p>This section applies to consumers residing in California under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) and related regulations. For these consumers, this section controls if it conflicts with other parts of the policy.</p>
            
              <h4>Definition</h4>
              <p>“Personal information” has the meaning given in the CCPA/CPRA.</p>
            
              <h3>Categories of personal information we collect</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>We have collected the following categories of personal information:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Identifiers</li>
                    <li>Internet or other electronic network activity information</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>We do not collect sensitive personal information.</li>
                <li>We will not collect additional categories without notice.</li>
              </ul>
            
              <h3>Purposes for using personal information</h3>
              <p><strong>Business purposes.</strong> We use personal information to operate this website and its features. Processing is necessary and proportionate to the purposes for which the information was collected and limited to compatible operational uses.</p>
              <p><strong>Commercial/legal purposes.</strong> We may also use personal information for other commercial reasons, to comply with law, and to protect our rights and interests, including before competent authorities.</p>
              <p><strong>No incompatible use.</strong> We will not process personal information for unexpected or incompatible purposes without your consent.</p>
            
              <h3>Retention</h3>
              <p>Unless otherwise stated in <em>Detailed information on the processing of personal data</em>, we retain personal information only as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected (or longer if required by law).</p>
            
              <h3>Sources of personal information</h3>
              <p>We collect personal information directly and indirectly from you when you use this website.</p>
              <p><strong>Direct collection:</strong> e.g., when you submit a form.</p>
              <p><strong>Indirect collection:</strong> e.g., through your site navigation; certain data is observed/collected automatically.</p>
              <p><strong>Third parties:</strong> we may receive personal information from service providers and partners supporting the website and its features.</p>
            
              <h3>How we disclose, sell, or share information</h3>
              <p><strong>Disclosure for business purposes.</strong> We may disclose personal information to third parties (not including “service providers” or “contractors” as defined by the CCPA) as listed in <em>Detailed information on the processing of personal data</em>. Those third parties are grouped by processing purpose.</p>
              <p><strong>Sale or sharing.</strong> “Sale” means providing personal information to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration. “Sharing” means providing personal information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising (whether or not consideration is exchanged). Transfers to service providers under a compliant written contract are not “sales” or “sharing.”</p>
            
              <h3>Opt-out rights</h3>
              <p>We may sell or share your personal information as described above. You have the right to opt out at any time. You can contact us using the details at the start of this document or use the privacy choices link on this website. We honor user-enabled Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals. We will use any information provided with an opt-out request solely to comply with that request and will wait at least 12 months before asking you to re-authorize sale or sharing.</p>
            
              <h3>Your CCPA/CPRA rights and how to exercise them</h3>
              <p><strong>Right to know and portability.</strong> You may request that we disclose:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>the categories of personal information we collected about you;</li>
                <li>the sources of that information;</li>
                <li>the purposes for which we use it;</li>
                <li>the categories of third parties to whom we disclose it; and</li>
                <li>the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You also have the right to know what personal information we sold or shared and to whom, including two separate lists showing: (i) the categories sold or shared and the categories of third parties; and (ii) the categories disclosed for a business purpose and the categories of recipients. Disclosures generally cover the preceding 12 months (and beyond January 1, 2022 when technically feasible and not disproportionately burdensome). Electronic disclosures will be provided in a portable, readily usable format where feasible.</p>
            
              <p><strong>Right to delete.</strong> You may request deletion of your personal information, subject to legal exceptions (e.g., security, fraud prevention, debugging, or to fulfill transactions).</p>
              <p><strong>Right to correct.</strong> You may request correction of inaccurate personal information we maintain about you.</p>
              <p><strong>Right to opt out of sale/sharing and to limit use of sensitive personal information.</strong> You may opt out at any time. (We do not collect sensitive personal information.)</p>
              <p><strong>Non-discrimination.</strong> We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights. If certain information is necessary to provide a service, we may be unable to complete a transaction without it.
